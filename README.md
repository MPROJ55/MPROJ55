# 🏄‍♂️ Matthew Lassiter

**`College Student`**

I'm a college student at GMU currently studying Cybersecurity. I’m passionate about security, web development, and artificial intelligence, and I’m constantly working on projects that combine these fields. My GitHub is a space where I:

Explore security concepts, tools, and practices

Build web applications and backend systems

Experiment with AI models and apply them to real-world problems

I enjoy learning by building, breaking things down, and improving them — whether it’s writing code, configuring systems, or diving into new frameworks and technologies.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Matthews's journey/h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey in my last year of highschool. I learned through building small games in Java. This is where my interest in coding began.
   It inspired me to learn other languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I currently am trying to learn the C programming language. Different operating systems aswell as shell scripting and batch scripting also interests me. I have setup differnt virtual machine enviroments to tinker and learn!
